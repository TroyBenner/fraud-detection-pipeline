Recovering from Investment Fraud: Start with These 6 Steps
MAY 01, 2025
 

Most of us know someone who’s been a victim of a financial scam, or we might have been a target ourselves. If you’ve been impacted by this type of crime, there are ways you can get both financial and emotional assistance.

The toll of investment fraud can extend well beyond lost money. You might be coping with the aftermath of a compromised identity, damaged credit and financial loss, as well as a range of emotions, including anger, fear and frustration. You’re not alone. A study funded by the FINRA Foundation found that nearly two-thirds of fraud victims experience at least one severe emotional consequence—including severe stress, anxiety, insomnia and depression. Resources are available that can help.

Perpetrators will frequently dispose of your money immediately after taking it, so you might never get it back. Depending on the severity of the fraud, part of your recovery might require re-mapping your spending plans in light of any changes to your financial stability. However, your recovery is also about finding ways to recover emotionally from the crime and protecting yourself from future scam attempts.

While full financial recovery might be difficult to achieve, it’s critical that you report the crime as quickly as possible. Reporting any financial fraud, no matter how small, helps law enforcement, regulators, government agencies and other organizations put a stop to the fraud, prevent harm to more consumers, and pursue the criminals committing the fraud.

Investment Fraud Recovery Checklist

Taking the steps below can help you reclaim power from the fraudsters and begin to move forward.

1. Create a file. Start by collecting all relevant documentation concerning the fraud in one file that you keep in a secure location. The file should include all the information you have, including the perpetrator's name (and any other names provided to you), contact information and other details, such as a website address. Note any associated financial account information, including affected accounts and, in the case of crypto assets, the transaction hash and deposit address. If the perpetrator claimed to be registered, include the purported regulatory registration numbers, if available. Document the timeline of events—whether days, months or years—and save screenshots of all communications. Include any reports you made to law enforcement and a copy of your most recent credit report from all three credit reporting companies.

2. Report fraud to regulators. National, federal and state regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations for investment products and professionals may be able to help. You might benefit from reporting the investment fraud to as many as apply.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): 800-SEC-0330 or file a complaint.
FINRA: 844-574-3577 or file a tip.
North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA): 202-737-0900 or file a complaint.
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC): Report fraud or file a complaint to your state commissioner.
NFA: 312-781-1410 or 800-621-3570 or file a complaint.
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): 866-366-2382 or file a tip or complaint.

3. Report the fraud to law enforcement. Reporting the investment fraud to law enforcement is important to begin the recovery process, enable agencies to investigate responsible parties and prevent further damage to other individuals.

Federal Law Enforcement: You can report investment scams and suspicious communication to the Federal Trade Commission and/or to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center.
You can also report the fraud to your state attorney general’s office, district attorney and/or local police department.

4. Know your rights. Federal and, in some cases, state laws give rights to victims of crime. Learn about your rights to better protect yourself. Start with your nearest U.S. attorney’s office to learn more about crime victim rights and resources available to you. Also check with your state attorney general.

NASAA publishes a helpful “Investor Bill of Rights.” And the VictimConnect Resource Center is a referral helpline where crime victims can learn about their rights and options confidentially and compassionately.

5. Consider your options. It can be difficult to recover assets lost to investment fraud, particularly if the fraud was perpetrated by criminals from outside the U.S. Depending upon the scenario, there might be legitimate avenues to pursue that could help you recoup some of your lost assets through a civil lawsuit, arbitration or mediation. Attorneys with experience working on financial fraud cases might be able to counsel you on which remedies are available, depending on your circumstances.

6. Seek support. Scams can have both a financial and an emotional impact. Consider whether you need professional assistance with your post-fraud financial picture. If you’re experiencing guilt, embarrassment, shame or similar painful emotions as a result of the fraud, seek additional support. In addition to trusted family or friends, consider contacting a professional or joining a support group such as the following:

Give an Hour, Peer Support Program: Free, monthly virtual programs led by mental health counselors for both victims and family members.
FightCybercrime, Romance Scam Recovery Group: Free, 10-week virtual programs led by trained counselors for individuals affected by romance and relationship scams.
AARP Fraud Watch Network Helpline: A helpline, as well as a free discussion group, staffed by trained fraud specialists and volunteers.

If you’ve been a victim of investment fraud, you’re more likely to be retargeted, perhaps for a different type of scam. Be on your guard. Learn more about how to avoid fraud and strategies to protect yourself.

Disrupting the Cycle of Financial Fraud Through Collaboration and Innovation,https://www.finra.org/media-center/speeches/disrupting-cycle-financial-fraud-through-collaboration-innovation-091224,"ROBERT W. COOK

President and Chief Executive Officer, FINRA

Disrupting the Cycle of Financial Fraud Through Collaboration and Innovation
SEPTEMBER 12, 2024

As prepared for delivery

Today’s conversation on disrupting the cycle of financial fraud is important and timely—and we are grateful to have been able to convene such a distinguished group of regulators, policymakers, academics, law enforcement agencies, advocacy groups and financial firms here today. You all play a vital role in protecting investors, advocating for victims and working to stop fraud before it occurs. 

Disrupting the cycle of financial fraud is a continuing challenge for all of us, but it is a challenge that we must embrace together in order to succeed. 

Victims of fraud lost more than $10 billion in 2023, according to the Federal Trade Commission.1 Almost half of those losses were the result of investment fraud. And we can be certain that even this number is underreported. Victims often may be hesitant to report fraud because they feel ashamed—a pattern consistent with FINRA Foundation research on how the impact of financial fraud extends far beyond the direct financial damages.2 

Victims can suffer both mentally and emotionally, and they may even give up on participating in our markets altogether. The Foundation’s research also shows these outcomes are exacerbated by a society that often blames the victim—whether consciously or not.3 

Unfortunately, we know fraudsters—many of whom are not registered with any agency and operate outside of ongoing regulatory oversight—will relentlessly try to coopt any relationship and any resource to further their malicious schemes. Technology, despite its incredible benefits, also makes it cheaper and easier for bad actors to target victims. Criminals are working together via the Dark Web. They share expertise to create fake email addresses, assume identities, impersonate regulators, law enforcement and financial services firms to obtain sensitive personal and financial information.

They reach across national borders and outside the jurisdiction of local law enforcement. They exploit the convenience of online accounts and mobile apps through hacking, phishing and other scams. They manipulate payment mechanisms to facilitate their schemes and make it harder to trace their activities. And now they are using artificial intelligence to become even faster and more effective at perpetrating their crimes.

We also see cases in which our member firms and their individual financial professionals are themselves victims of third-party fraud, typically through some form of imposter scheme.

A related challenge we face is that investors are increasingly turning to the internet and to social media—and the unregistered actors on those platforms—for investment advice. FINRA Foundation research has found that almost half of Gen Z investors learn about investing and finances primarily through social media and internet searches, and their top online financial resource is YouTube.4 

This trend is concerning. While there are many unregistered finfluencers or other persons providing useful information to retail investors, sometimes the advice in this space is wrong, inaccurate or questionable—whether from a lack of knowledge, training or bad intent—and the potential for fraud is manifest. 

Regulating speech in this context, even inaccurate or misleading speech, presents challenging issues in light of legitimate free-speech concerns. While we can and do have prophylactic rules regarding registered securities professionals, these do not govern the many unregistered actors outside of our or other regulators’ jurisdiction who are becoming an increasing source of advice and information. 

Fighting Fraud Must Be a Team Endeavor

To address these concerns, we need to collaborate, or we risk falling behind. Fighting fraud is a team endeavor. Each of us must contribute our respective resources and capabilities, but ultimately, we can only succeed if we work together. 

In our interconnected financial world, no one agency or organization has comprehensive insight into all potential fraud activity, so we need to share knowledge and expertise to understand and address the sophisticated threats we face. 

Today, I would like to offer a few examples of how FINRA collaborates with other stakeholders in this space and a few areas where we might work more closely together to disrupt the cycle of fraud.

In recent years, FINRA has been keenly focused on encouraging collaboration and cooperation in combating fraud. As we celebrate our 85th year as a self-regulatory organization, FINRA sits at a unique intersection between government, our member firms and investors. One of our defining characteristics is our ability to engage with the brokerage industry to draw on their expertise and knowledge and use this to enrich our regulatory program. We do this, in part, by sharing actionable intelligence as quickly as possible with our member firms, as well as with investors and our regulatory and law enforcement colleagues.

For example, in recent years we have ramped up our efforts to provide real-time alerts to member firms about emerging or ongoing fraud and cyber threats.5 By sharing this information quickly, we empower firms to promptly protect their customers and themselves—hopefully before any damage is done. 

We provide this information to firms in many ways, including on social media and on our website. But sometimes we share this information directly to firms without putting anything on our public channels, because we have seen situations where fraudsters adapt their tactics in response to our alerts. In recent years, we have issued about a dozen cyber-focused alerts annually, plus additional general threat alerts to warn firms and the public about ongoing risks.

Firms often thank us for providing information like this that helps them avoid a fraud. While we always appreciate the thanks, we encourage those firms to take it a step further and commit to proactively telling us when they see a problem, so that information can benefit everyone. We know that delays in sharing critical information can be costly in the world of fast-paced frauds we see today. To borrow a familiar saying, we really need firms that see something to say something.

With respect to our rulebook, we have collaborated extensively with other regulators and the industry to update our standards to permit firms to respond proactively to potential fraud against seniors and other vulnerable investors if they reasonably believe financial exploitation may be occurring.6 

Separately, our risk monitoring teams assigned to every member firm conduct ongoing assessments of developing risks, help us identify and respond to firms that might have greater vulnerabilities and serve as a resource to firms as they look to address emerging threats.

We host conferences and webinars for our member firms on the latest fraud trends impacting the industry. We connect them with local FBI offices through regional threat briefings to ensure they have the right law enforcement contact information on hand should they need it. And we conduct joint industry training sessions with state regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), FBI and others to help us better collaborate and share best practices around emerging regulatory risks.

In addition to examinations and training, our enforcement actions are a key tool in fighting fraud and misconduct among our member firms and individuals. In 2023, FINRA recovered $88.4 million in fines, including disgorgement awards of $2.9 million. Enforcement actions last year also resulted in $7.5 million in restitution to harmed investors, the expulsion of five firms, the suspension of 257 brokers, and 178 brokers being barred from FINRA membership.

Given that FINRA only has jurisdiction over its member firms and then only with respect to certain violations of securities laws or FINRA rules, we also actively coordinate with law enforcement, exchanges7 and other regulators to address suspected criminal activity outside our jurisdiction. 

In 2023, FINRA made more than 2,000 fraud referrals to our fellow regulators and criminal authorities—and this year we are on pace to make about 3,000. We also have ramped up our ability to collaborate through Memoranda of Understanding with other regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), SEC, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Futures Association (NFA), so that we can efficiently address concerns that fall within our respective regulatory mandates.

At the end of the day, our goal is to work with everyone who has a stake in protecting investors—from regulators and firms to researchers and victim advocates—to provide venues and processes for sharing intelligence regarding frauds and promoting effective practices for combating them. 

Enhancing Fraud Fighting Tools

In that spirit of working together, I want to highlight a few areas where we might further coordinate our efforts to proactively disrupt financial fraud. Each build on the notion that while regulators and firms must lead this effort day in and day out, we can also empower all stakeholders—including investors—to play a greater role by facilitating their access to relevant information and insights that we collectively develop in the course of our regulatory work. 

FINRA has long sought to provide investors and other interested parties with relevant disclosures regarding financial professionals. For more than three decades, we have developed a great deal of experience in maintaining public databases that provide this crucial information, including through BrokerCheck®. 

As many of you may know, BrokerCheck® is a website that tells you instantly whether a person or firm is registered to sell securities, as required by law. It also gives a snapshot of a broker's employment history, regulatory actions and other background information. The information in BrokerCheck® is derived from a database operated by FINRA that maintains the federal and state registration records of broker-dealer firms and their associated professionals.

FINRA also is the developer and operator, under contract with the SEC, of a similar resource for information on investment advisers. The Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website, or IAPD, is based on a database of federal and state investment adviser registration information. In fact, we have worked to link BrokerCheck® and IAPD, so investors do not need to know the difference between a broker and an investment adviser to benefit from the information in both systems.

Other financial agencies and related organizations also have public databases or websites with information regarding firms or individuals they regulate or with whom consumers may interact, including information regarding enforcement actions with respect to registered and unregistered persons. But other than BrokerCheck® and IAPD, linkages generally do not exist between these databases. As a result, investors and consumers who try to perform their own due diligence on someone pitching them on a financial product or service face daunting challenges. 

They first need to identify and check the right website for the relevant product or service they are interested in. Even then, they might only get an incomplete picture. Someone with a problematic history in one industry might move to another, so checking only one database might create the false impression that the person has a clean history. It may be necessary to check several relevant websites to get the full picture. The average person is unlikely to be aware of all the existing databases, to understand what they cover and what they do not and to check each that may be relevant.

And the fact remains that there are ""bad actors"" who are not licensed or registered to conduct business in any part of the financial services industry, and it can be difficult to find legal actions or criminal charges against these individuals. A person purporting to be a financial professional who fails to register as the law requires is a significant red flag, which underscores the importance of being readily able to tell whether someone is appropriately registered—and whether they have a history of misconduct. 

There have been calls in the past for establishing some form of unified, public data—in place of or in addition to the current disaggregated system of separate websites maintained by different federal and state agencies and related organizations—to make it easier for investors to research providers of products or services across the financial industry landscape.8 This is a worthy goal that would serve investors well. However, creating a single database of this type presents significant challenges, including building on and coordinating across existing reporting regimes established by different organizations using different standards and terminology to regulate different individuals, entities, services or products. 

In the meantime, a useful interim step might be to leverage technology to create a single portal where one can readily search for relevant public information across existing databases, without having to separately check or even know about each such database. This would build on the approach that FINRA implemented with respect to BrokerCheck® and IAPD, where an investor entering a name in one database will automatically receive relevant search results from both databases regarding that same name. 

I have asked FINRA staff to reach out to other database operators to explore whether we can create this type of one-stop shop for investor research, without needing to reengineer or integrate existing databases. A new unified database still might be a good approach, and we can support efforts to work towards that goal, but that will take time. In the meantime, it makes sense to explore facilitating easier access to the information that is already available today, if you just know where to look for it.

Another way in which we might further enhance our work together to disrupt financial fraud is by redoubling our efforts to speak with one voice when doing so might better serve the public. There often are important reasons for organizations to issue their own warnings regarding fraud. But if we put ourselves in the shoes of the average consumer, fragmented communications from different organizations in some instances may unintentionally dilute, narrow and weaken the message that needs to get through.

Fortunately, there are some excellent examples of agencies and other entities working effectively together to communicate jointly to their constituencies regarding fraud tactics. Just this week, for example, FINRA, the SEC, the CFTC and North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) issued an alert to warn investors about relationship investment scams.9 These are scenarios in which bad actors hide their true identities, reach out to unsuspecting targets (often online or through text messages), gain their trust over time and then defraud them through fake investments. 

And just yesterday, the American Bankers Association (ABA) Foundation worked with the FBI, three other federal law enforcement agencies, the SEC, the CFTC and FINRA to release a one-page infographic that financial institutions can use to warn their customers about certain crypto investment scams that are also referred to as “pig butchering schemes.”10 

Coordinated agency communications may be particularly valuable when, as in these cases, we are able to identify common fraud tactics that can be perpetrated by different bad actors across various products, services and platforms, that have similar red flags and that may be mitigated through similar preventative measures. 

Indeed, joint communications about particular fraud tactics and the steps investors and others can take to safeguard themselves from them, may be as important as the disclosures we work to provide regarding particular firms or individuals, especially considering that fraud perpetrators can mask or change their identities to employ the same tactic over and over again. In addition, one perpetrator can only do so much damage, but fraud strategies can be used by many perpetrators against many victims, across jurisdictional boundaries and in both regulated and unregulated spaces. And because it is easier to quickly identify a fraud trend to watch out for than a person to watch out for, prompt and coordinated communications about fraud tactics can enable a broad range of investors and industry participants to safeguard themselves more proactively against fraud. 

I have asked our team at FINRA to consider how we can play our part to enhance our work with other agencies and organizations and amplify the impact of our combined communications to further address common fraud tactics. We might even consider whether this is another instance in which investors would benefit from a single, centralized resource that aggregates regulators’ and other stakeholders’ collective experiences and expertise regarding different types of fraud.

Conclusion

Fighting fraud is difficult, but it is vitally important work. Your participation in this conversation today shows your support for the teamwork and coordination necessary to be successful in our collective efforts. For that, I want to express my appreciation to all of you on behalf of FINRA and the FINRA Foundation, and I look forward to our future collaboration.

Thank you.

FULL TRANSCRIPT

 

00:00 - 00:23

Margherita Beale: Amid a growing and changing financial fraud landscape, and as we celebrate National Consumer Protection Week, the time is ripe to talk about the ways in which investors can protect themselves from financial scams. On this episode, a member of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation joins us to talk about how we can all become more informed and vigilant consumers in today's complex financial world. 

 

00:32 - 00:51

Margherita Beale: Welcome to FINRA Unscripted. I'm one of your co-hosts, Margherita Beale. Joining us today to talk about the latest fraud trends, common red flags to watch out for and practical steps investors can take to safeguard investments. Is Rob Mascio, Director of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. Rob, welcome back to the show. 

 

00:51 - 00:53

Rob Mascio: Hi. Thanks. Happy to be here. 

 

00:53 - 00:57

Margherita Beale: To start us off, can you introduce yourself and share a little bit about your background? 

 

00:58 - 02:14

Rob Mascio: Absolutely. So, Rob Mascio, I'm a director with FINRA's Office of Investor Education and the FINRA Foundation, and I have been with FINRA FINRA for over 19 years. During that course of my time with FINRA, I've had the pleasure of working in a lot of different departments, which has really been able to shape the way that I approach the program that I'm responsible for within the foundation. So, I started my career in Market Regulation, focusing on fixed income and derivative products, did that for several years, and then had the opportunity to work within Member Supervision in the examination program. I was an examiner. Then I was an examination manager for a period of time. And then in 2015, FINRA launched the Securities Helpline for Seniors, and I was able to come on board as the manager of that program, led that program for several years. And then in 2020, I had the opportunity to join the FINRA Foundation, and I was able to take a lot of the investigative work that I've done throughout the majority of my career and bring that over to the foundation, where I was able to take more of a proactive approach to financial fraud, financial exploitation, and really try to make an impact on investors before they were targeted, before they potentially became victims of financial fraud. And I was really excited about that kind of an opportunity. 

 

02:15 - 02:21

Margherita Beale: As a plug, I think that this year is the 10-year anniversary of the helpline. Is that right? 

 

02:21 - 02:28

Rob Mascio: It sure is. Absolutely. We launched on April 20 of 2015. So we're coming up on that 10-year anniversary. 

 

02:28 - 02:39

Margherita Beale: I know it's a very valuable resource. So also speaking of the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, for those who may not be familiar, can you just tell us a bit more about what that is? 

 

02:39 - 03:30

Rob Mascio: The FINRA Foundation, it's a subsidiary of FINRA. We have our own board that we ultimately report to. And the goal of the foundation is to improve financial capabilities for all Americans. And the way that we do that is, if you think about the program, we're separated really into two separate kind of groups. One focuses on that building wealth component. So what individuals can do throughout their community to become knowledgeable about finance to help build that initial wealth. Then on the other side, we've got the protecting wealth side of the foundation, and that's where I spend the majority of my time focusing on that, protecting wealth. And that's working with a variety of different organizations to come up with a plan to help protect consumers from financial fraud and financial exploitation. And when individuals become targeted and victimized, what kind of support mechanisms can we put in place to assist those individuals? 

 

03:30 - 03:47

Margherita Beale: That's perfect timing because this week is National Consumer Protection Week. So, as we think about that, can you give us an overview of the current landscape of financial fraud and maybe give us some real-world examples of fraudulent schemes that have targeted investors recently? 

 

03:48 - 04:29

Rob Mascio: The fraud landscape is constantly shifting, constantly changing. The thing that's interesting about fraud. And I like to use the analogy of ice cream. I think a lot of people can maybe relate with this. So, a lot of people like ice cream. But when you think about ice cream, there's really only a few ingredients to make ice cream. So, you've got milk, you've got sugar, you've got cream. Those are the core ingredients to make any kind of ice cream. Right now, there's a lot of different flavors of ice cream. And when you think about fraud, those tactics, those ingredients are often the same. It's the end product that might be different. And over time, we see fraudsters who have used those same tactics and just altered their mechanisms a little bit. 

 

04:29 - 05:37

Rob Mascio: So, let me take a step back and talk a little bit about the fraud landscape. And this is information that we know from the Federal Trade Commission who has a reporting mechanism for consumers to report. And then from that we're able to extract a lot of really interesting data. But this is what we know. There was $10.3 billion lost to fraud in 2023. Now looking at the numbers for 2024, the data that is available, it looks like we're on track to unfortunately meet or exceed those numbers. So, $10.3 billion in losses. That's over 2.6 million fraud complaints to the Federal Trade Commission. And of that $10.3 billion, $4.6 billion was lost to investment-related fraud. Now, when we talk about investment-related fraud for purposes of this, it takes into account a variety of different types of frauds. So that could include your typical investment-related frauds that you might think about this Ponzi schemes, those types of things, but it also includes crypto-related investment fraud. So it's important to keep that in mind that this does include that crypto component, as well as that more traditional investment related fraud that we might think about. 

 

05:37 - 06:20

Rob Mascio: Now, this is just the information that we know. This is based off of people that have come forward and reported their instances. This does not include all those individuals out there who have been victimized, who have been targeted, who have not reported. So when we think about these numbers, that $10.3 billion number, that's a huge number. It's even larger when you take into account those individuals who have not come forward and have not reported their instances. And there's a variety of reasons that people might not come forward. They might not know where to go. They might be embarrassed. They might be ashamed. They might be afraid to report. There's a variety of different scenarios, and there's even instances where individuals might not have realized that they've been victimized at this point yet. 

 

06:20 - 07:45

Rob Mascio: With those statistics in mind, some of the fraud trends that we're seeing and again, frauds are sometimes based off of what's currently going on. So in the time that there maybe is a natural disaster, maybe it's fires or a hurricane or something like that, fraudsters often leverage those types of situations to find their targets. We're also seeing a rise in crypto. Related. I mentioned that that $4.6 million in investment related fraud does include crypto. Some of the frauds that we're seeing, they are in the crypto space, and we're seeing a confluence of romance-related, companionship-related scams and crypto related, and those we refer to as either investment-related or crypto-relationship type scams. It could be that text message that you get from somebody that you don't know, but asks the question like, ""Are you available to golf on Tuesday?"" or ""It's been a long time since we've caught up, do you want to put a call together to chat?"" something along those lines, something innocent. It's from a number you don't know. And a lot of people, because we're nice, good people, we might respond and say, ""I'm sorry, I think you might have the wrong number."" And that starts the conversation from there that opens up the door for that individual to communicate. Then the communication continues. You start to build up that friendship. And this is why these are not necessarily romantic types of relationships. These are relationships that are cultivated and built, possibly around a shared interest, and they're more geared towards friendships. 

 

07:45 - 09:04

Rob Mascio: So that communication starts happening. You might be talking more and more frequently. There could be a romantic connection. There maybe isn't a romantic connection, but ultimately, at the end of the day, these conversations move over to some other platform. They move over to, you know, ""I just want to let you know about this investment opportunity that I've been really successful at. If it's something you're interested, I'm happy to help you out. I'm happy to teach you."" And those are often in the crypto space. And a lot of times these are fictitious platforms that are created and designed simply to extract money from individuals. So they might have you open up an account on a trading platform, and you open up the account, you put your information in, and maybe you just transfer in a little bit of money because, well, you've heard all the information about how you shouldn't be trusting people. You shouldn't just be dumping your entire life savings into a single product. So maybe you start small and you start investing and you start to see that this investment, this crypto-related investment is increasing in value. You might even try to take a little bit of money out and they might let you. So that kind of builds up your confidence. Then you deposit more money and ultimately the end of the day, when you try to get those funds out, you either can't or you're told you have to pay some kind of tax to withdraw those funds. And again, these are fake platforms that that are designed simply to steal your money. So that's one of the frauds that we're seeing on the rise. 

 

09:04 - 10:09

Rob Mascio: We're also seeing a rise in investment club type of frauds. And again those could start off as an innocent message. Maybe a message you get through an encrypted message platform, something like WhatsApp, something along those lines. And you're invited to join this investment club where you're taught how to trade. Maybe it's low price securities, maybe it's cryptocurrency. And these are other networks that are designed to operate essentially a pump-and-dump type of scheme where they get a bunch of investors to invest, maybe in that low price security and they tell you exactly what to do. They tell you what price to get in at, how long you have to hold those positions, and they ultimately try to convince you that there's this certain exit strategy. So as individuals are starting to invest, they're starting to see that price go up and up and up. And those that are on the inside, they know that price is going up. They're also holding a large amount of this underlying security, and then they liquidate once it hits a certain point. Those that are not on the inside end up losing a lot of money. So these are investment club scams. They're significantly on the rise. 

 

10:09 - 10:49

Rob Mascio: The thing that a lot of these have in common is that they're all forms of impersonations. And going back to the Federal Trade Commission information that I talked about a little bit earlier, impersonation scams, that's the top fraud that is being reported. So whether it's impersonating an individual that's trying to be your friend, impersonating a financial professional, trying to give you advice, impersonating maybe a government agency, whether it's an IRS agent, whether it's somebody at the Securities and Exchange Commission, maybe it's even claiming to be somebody that works for FINRA. Those are all forms of impersonation. And those are absolutely the the highest reported frauds that we're seeing out there today. 

 

10:51 - 11:09

Margherita Beale: As investors are faced with this changing and evolving landscape of financial fraud, what are some of the common red flags that they should be on the lookout for when evaluating investment opportunities? And what are some of the tactics that are used by fraudsters that they should be on the lookout for? 

 

00:11:10:00 - 00:12:02:00

Rob Mascio: So fraudsters leverage emotion. That's one of their main tactics that are used. And our emotions are such an important role of us as human beings, as individuals and fraudsters look for ways that they can manipulate our emotions, and they might use things like fear. They might use fear to manipulate your emotions to make somebody react quickly. They might use opportunity. So maybe it's the opportunity to possibly make a lot of money to change the course of your financial future. They might use a variety of different tactics, and the things that are interesting is these are essentially marketing tactics that have been used by marketers and been used by individuals looking to deceive people for years and years and years. And some of those tactics might come across as things like phantom riches.

 

12:02 - 13:49

Rob Mascio: So phantom riches is a persuasion tactic where you're essentially dangling that prospect of wealth in front of somebody. So talking about painting that picture of what your life might look like if you had that sudden windfall of money, they might use terms like ""it's risk-free"" or ""guaranteed returns"" or ""high returns."" Those are some of those terms that are thrown out there to get people excited again, playing with the emotion, getting them excited, wanting to move forward. They might use other tactics like scarcity. So scarcity is a play where maybe it's a limited time opportunity or it's only open to a certain number of people, and you're one of those selected individuals. That makes people feel special, feel excited. They don't want to miss out on that opportunity. They don't want to miss out on something that's going fast or it's exclusive. So it might prompt them to react in a way that they might not under normal circumstances. Again, it's that play on emotion. They might use tactics such as social consensus, and that's one where you're essentially saying that, listen, there's a lot of other people that are doing this. It's safe. You should do it too. It might be a tactic that's used when you're targeting an affinity group or a group of like-minded individuals. So social consensus is one of that plays that makes people feel comfortable that, ""Oh, well, there's other people that are doing it. It's OK for me to do it too."" It helps drop that person's guard down again, playing with that emotion. There's reciprocity, which is that concept of I'm going to do something small for you in hopes that you'll do something in return. And fraudsters know that that messes with our emotion and that that can cause people to sometimes act in ways, again, that they wouldn't normally do under normal circumstances. 

 

13:49 - 15:28

Rob Mascio: Source credibility is the last one that I'll touch on on these tactics. And there was a reason that at the beginning of this podcast, you had me talk about my experience with FINRA, how long I've been with the organization. That's to build up credibility. That's so everybody that's listening can say, OK, well, this individual who's talking, maybe he has some experience. Maybe I should continue to listen. It helps build up that trust. It helps you all feel comfortable with that. What I'm saying might actually hold some weight and it keeps you interested. That's how source credibility works. And fraudsters leverage that. It might look like somebody that's dressed nice. Maybe they're wearing a nice suit or driving a nice car, or they have a really great corner office overlooking the water, whatever it may be. These are different plays to add potential credibility to that individual. Now credibility, it's that shortcut to trust, but it can easily be faked. Anybody can print up a business card that says whatever title they want, or put some initials after their name to show what kind of accreditations they might hold themselves out to having. So it's a really powerful emotional tactic that is used. And again, the presence of these doesn't necessarily mean something is a fraud. These are marketing tactics. Anybody who's watched any home shopping type of show and infomercial, these tactics are in play constantly. You've got a countdown clock that says how long you have to purchase that Tupperware or whatever the product is that they're selling. It talks about the number of people that have bought it. Again, these are marketing tactics, and marketers use them because they work. And individuals that are looking to deceive people use them because unfortunately they do work. They toy with our emotions. 

 

15:29 - 16:19

Rob Mascio: With that being said, there are of course certain red flags that are associated when presented with a potential opportunity. So leveraging some of these tactics when you have to make a decision quick, that could potentially be a red flag because that individual was trying to have you respond quickly without you thinking. So at that time, scarcity piece, that can be a red flag. Of course, whenever we hear guaranteed returns when it comes to the securities industry, that's a red flag. So we've got limited opportunity. We have guarantees. Those are red flags. Another red flag could be if somebody tells you not to tell somebody else about this opportunity. That's a play on scarcity where it's a limited opportunity. But individuals who are trying to deceive you might say, well, you can't talk about this to anybody else. You're on the inside, don't share it with anybody else. And that's the red flag. 

 

16:21 - 16:34

Margherita Beale: Research is definitely one way that investors can safeguard against fraud. So what are some steps that one can take to look into an investment or financial professional before committing their money? 

 

16:34 - 17:35:17

Rob Mascio: I will say that through some of the research that the FINRA Foundation has done and the FINRA Foundation, we conduct a lot of research, which is really interesting about our group, and we use that research to really implement different types of strategies for consumers. And one of the items that we found through research about what separates victims from non-victims when it comes to financial fraud and scams, is this concept of knowledge. So the more that we know, the better protected we are, the more we know about the frauds that are out there, the scams that are out there, how they work, how they operate, what some of these tactics are. That type of knowledge causes individuals to more easily be able to identify potentially fraudulent opportunities. And if they do end up engaging with somebody, it still can serve as a protective measure. We see that individuals are less likely to lose money or share personal information if they know about the scam tactics that are out there. So knowledge is really such a key component to protecting consumers. 

 

17:35 - 18:30

Rob Mascio: Now, there's a lot of other resources out there. If it is a specific product or a specific opportunity that you want to be able to vet, and you want to be able to look into, research is really an important tool to take as an investor, as an individual. So you always want to be able to try and verify information to an independent source. So if somebody is pitching you some kind of an opportunity, you can use a search engine, use a basic search to look for what other people are saying about that opportunity. And one of the tips when you're doing that search, when you're going to whatever search engine you choose, if you just type ""fraud"" or ""scam"" or ""complaint"" after that opportunity or that investment, whatever it is, you're going to see potentially different results. What other people might have reported. This all comes into that total decision making process. So using that information to better inform you about what other people are saying, it's ultimately help drive your final decision. 

 

18:31 - 19:17

Rob Mascio: Of course, whenever it's something that's in the securities world. We want to check to make sure that the individual that's offering this is licensed to be selling securities. So BrokerCheck, of course, is a wonderful tool to be able to research if an individual is actually licensed to be transacting within the securities industry. It's also a great tool to look up a firm to see if the firm that this individual is working for is a licensed firm to be transacting in the securities industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission has their EDGAR filings to be able to look more into certain companies a little bit deeper, to find more filed information about those companies. So you're going to a lot of different sources to try and compile this information on your own, not just taking the word of that individual that is pitching you this opportunity. 

 

19:18 - 19:26

Margherita Beale: When engaging with a financial professional, what types of questions should investors ask to properly vet them? 

 

19:27 - 20:21

Rob Mascio: One, you want to definitely be able to verify that they are licensed. You always want to make sure that the person that you're dealing with in the securities industry is licensed, and you can ask that individual about their employment history. You can also verify that information through BrokerCheck. So how long they've been in the industry. Maybe you can ask them about certain products that they might potentially specialize in. So there's questions along that. It's also OK to ask the individual if it's a certain product, how they're going to be compensated. I know it's often uncomfortable to ask somebody how they're getting paid, but that is information, as an investor that you should know, how is that person going to be compensated. When it comes to specific investments, making sure that you're understanding the liquidity of that product. If you do need to get money out at a certain point in time, what's the process for getting money out for maybe liquidating a position. So asking questions around liquidity, those are all great questions to be able to ask somebody. 

 

20:22 - 20:30

Margherita Beale: In a more proactive sense, can you share some practical strategies that investors can use to help safeguard their savings from fraud?

 

20:31 - 21:34

Rob Mascio: The thing that's interesting about fraud as it comes at us from a lot of different sources. So there's the one side of fraud where somebody's pitching you that opportunity. So knowing about those red flags, asking questions, maybe even leveraging somebody else, that trusted individual that you might feel comfortable talking to, using them as a sounding board to be able to bounce the opportunity off of them. Sometimes just having a second person to talk to and explain that opportunity might help you sort through some of the things. We've talked about how fraud comes from a lot of different angles, making sure that your accounts are protected so you've got the pitched frauds, but then you also have the frauds and the scams that are coming at us from different angles, whether it's an individual trying to do an account takeover of our email, of our brokerage accounts. So we always want to make sure that we're checking our financial statements, whether it's your financial institution, whether it's your credit card company, whatever it may be, checking our statements to make sure that we recognize what's happening in those accounts, that's an important measure. 

 

21:34 - 22:28

Rob Mascio: Having good cyber hygiene, which essentially means not reusing passwords, having different passwords for different accounts. We shouldn't have an email account that has the same username and password as our financial institution accounts, because if one of those accounts gets compromised, that individual who has taken over that account, they're going to use that username and password for any account that they can think of to see whether or not there's a hit. So, making sure that we have different usernames, different passwords for our different accounts. Leveraging things like multi-factor authentication. If somebody is trying to get into one of your accounts, it has to get authenticated through a different way. Maybe it's a text message coming to your phone. Something along those lines. Maybe it's the facial recognition, something like that, to verify that you are who you say you are in two different ways. So multi-factor authentication is a great step to take. 

 

22:29 - 22:34

Margherita Beale: If someone suspects that they have been a victim of financial fraud, what should they do?

 

22:35 - 24:23

Rob Mascio: If somebody has been unfortunately victimized, the one thing that you're definitely going to want to make sure that you do is encourage that individual to report. So, the more information that we can have reported, the more that the community knows about the different frauds, the different trends, the different things that are happening within the fraud space. So encouraging someone to report is definitely an important tactic. Now, one thing that's really important to keep in mind is, an individual who has been victimized, they are going through likely a significantly traumatic event, and that's going to show up in a lot of different ways, and it's going to be different for everybody. So everybody has their own mechanism in which they can withstand different types of trauma. And if you are in a position to work with somebody or assist somebody who has been victimized, it's so important to recognize that there is that underlying trauma. We know that people who have reported being victimized have experienced different emotional impacts to a severe extent, and that's things like difficulty sleeping, anxiety, emotional impacts such as those. So looking for ways to make that individual feel comfortable is really important. Looking for strategies to help them regain some control. Maybe it's something as simple as filing that report, telling them to go file a police report, report it to FINRA, maybe to the FBI, whatever the appropriate reporting mechanism is for that specific type of fraud. But it's so important to remember that the words that we use, they are really impactful. And by using words like, ""Oh, well, you fell for it,"" or ""I can't believe you gave money to that individual."" Those are words that have a really significant impact on an individual going through that traumatic fraud event. 

 

24:23 - 25:39

Rob Mascio: So we want to make sure that we're approaching this with compassion. We're looking for words that don't place blame on the victim, because the blame really needs to be on that perpetrator, on that individual that is deceiving and defrauding the person. So our words really need to match up with that. We need to make sure that we're checking our language. And if you're in a position that you're maybe investigating a situation, the questions that we ask play a significant role in building that comfort level and having that individual open up. So by asking more open ended questions and letting that person talk on their own terms, maybe it's not going to be a linear path to getting that information, but if that's the way that that victim or that person has to talk about the situation, let them talk about it. So asking questions like, ""Are you able to tell me more?"" we're letting them start where they want to start. Those are easy ways that we can make someone feel a little bit more comfortable as they're going through that traumatic experience. So making sure that we're checking our words is so important. Recognizing that people react differently to this type of a trauma. We know that people, they might isolate themselves, they might feel anxiety, might feel loneliness. So again, looking for ways to help them overcome that. 

 

25:39 - 26:55

Rob Mascio: There are a variety of different resources out there that can help individuals overcome that emotional impact. So one of the partners that the FINRA Foundation works with is an organization called Give an Hour and Give an Hour has a peer support program for victims and survivors of financial fraud. Their website that's giveanhour.org/financial fraud that'll take you to their financial fraud-specific content. On their web page, you'll be able to find information about peer support groups, where you can connect with other individuals who have been through that same kind of a trauma. There's a lot of different resources that they have on their website. Another organization that we work with is the Cybercrime Support Network and their website fightcybercrime.org. They run a peer support program for survivors and victims of romance related frauds and scams. So that's another great resource. If somebody has been victimized through a romance or companionship related scam or fraud, the BBB, the Better Business Bureau, they have a lot of great resources. Other organizations like AARP, they have their Fraud Watch Network, which allows you to talk to AARP volunteers about things that individual has been going through. 

 

26:55 - 28:46

Rob Mascio: Of course, we've got our FINRA Securities Helpline for Seniors, which is a fantastic resource. And for those that don't know that number, it's available on our website, but that number is (844) 574-3577. You'll be able to talk to a live individual within FINRA and share some of the different things that you're experiencing. So that's a great resource. Some of the other things on our FINRA website. So investor specific content. We've got a lot of really great content on FINRA.org/investors. And you'll find information for investors about different things that we're seeing out in the investment community, whether it's product specific, whether it's fraud specific. Those are our insight articles. So our investor insight articles, they're written in plain language for consumers. And they talk about a lot of different topics. Some are product specific. Some are fraud specific. So there's a lot of really great content there. I'll also mention our FINRA Foundation website. We have a lot of information. So if you are associated with a firm or you're in a position where you're working with individuals who might have been victimized. FINRA Foundation Mortgage Fraud Fighter, you'll find all of our fraud specific content there. So that's a great resource. And I'll also say every year FINRA comes out with our Annual Regulatory Oversight Report. So our 2025 Annual Regulatory Oversight Report has recently been released, and in that report, you'll be able to see some of the different areas of focus and different trends that FINRA is aware of and things that might be helpful for you all if you are working at a firm or something along those lines. Really great resource to keep in mind. So there's a variety of different resources out there. And if you are working with somebody who has been victimized, that compassion piece is so, so important as you're working with that individual. 

 

28:47 - 28:56

Margherita Beale: Thank you, Rob. To wrap us up today, if listeners could take away just one piece of advice from today's discussion, what would you want it to be? 

 

28:56 - 30:15

Rob Mascio: I'm going to go back to the topic of using appropriate words. So this is so important. We talked about the volume of fraud that's occurring out there. And we've talked about the number of instances that are likely not reported. Part of that again is people are embarrassed or afraid. They don't want to come forward. They don't want to mention that they were victimized. They might be embarrassed. And part of that has to do with the language that we use. Whether it's in the media, whether it's in a conversation, whether it's online, where somebody has gotten the courage to say, ""Oh, I was victimized here,"" or tell their story, the comments are often very negative. That has a significant impact to not only the person that's been through that trauma, but other individuals that are sitting on the sidelines afraid to report or looking at reading that story, whatever it may be, and saying, ""That happened to me too, but I'm not going to come forward because look how this person was attacked."" So using the right words, whether it's interacting with a client who's been victimized, a customer, a friend, a family member, whoever it may be, checking our words and approaching it with compassion. Because again, these frauds, they are perpetrated by individuals looking to deceive people, to exploit people. We should be putting the blame on those individuals, not on the person that's been targeted. 

 

30:15 - 30:37

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Investment Fraud,https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/artificial-intelligence-and-investment-fraud,"Avoid Fraud
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Investment Fraud
JANUARY 25, 2024
 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are jointly issuing this investor article to make investors aware of the increase of investment frauds involving the purported use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. Individual investors should know that bad actors are using the growing popularity and complexity of AI to lure victims into scams.

Here are a few things to look out for to help you keep your money safe from these frauds:

Unregistered/Unlicensed Investment Platforms Claiming to Use AI

First and foremost, investors should remember that federal, provincial and state securities laws generally require securities firms, professionals, exchanges and other investment platforms to be registered. A promoter’s lack of registration status should be taken as a prompt to do additional investigation before you invest any money. Numerous unregistered and unlicensed online investment platforms, as well as unlicensed and unregistered individuals and firms, are promoting AI trading systems that make unrealistic claims like, “Our proprietary AI trading system can’t lose!” or “Use AI to Pick Guaranteed Stock Winners!” In reality, these scammers are running investment schemes that seek to leverage the popularity of AI. Be wary of claims—even from registered firms and professionals—that AI can guarantee amazing investment returns.

Investment claims that sound too good to be true usually are. And remember: Fraudsters typically deploy multiple, sophisticated persuasion techniques to make their pitches seem real. Claims of high guaranteed investment returns with little or no risk are classic warning signs of fraud.

Steps you can take to protect yourself:

When trading securities or seeking investment advice, make sure you’re working with a registered investment professional and on a registered exchange or other type of registered investment platform. You can use the free Check Out Your Investment Professional search tool on Investor.gov to: (1) confirm registration status of investment professionals; and (2) check for any disciplinary history. In Canada, you can use the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Registration Search. To help research the validity of exchanges and other investment platforms, start by checking to see if they’re on the SEC’s list of national securities exchanges or registered alternative trading systems.  
You can also contact your state or provincial securities regulator. If you’re unsure who that is, please see NASAA’s “Contact Your Regulator” webpage.
Check out the SEC’s educational videos, the HoweyTrade Investment Program, for tips on spotting fake investment platforms and trading programs generally. 
Investing in Companies Involved in AI

It might seem exciting to invest in AI-focused companies that claim they’re leaders in developing or using this emerging technology. Companies might make claims about how AI will affect their business operations and drive profitability. While rapid technological change can create investment opportunities, bad actors often use the hype around new technological developments, like AI or crypto assets, to lure investors into schemes. These bad actors might use catchy AI-related buzzwords and make claims that their companies or business strategies guarantee huge gains. Red flags of these types of scams include high-pressure sales tactics by unregistered individuals, promises of quick profits, or claims of guaranteed returns with little or no risk.

False claims about a public company’s products and services relating to AI also might be part of a pump-and-dump scheme where fraudsters profit at the expense of unsuspecting investors. In a pump-and-dump scheme, promoters try to “pump” up, or increase, the stock price of a company by spreading positive, but false, information, usually online through ads, fake news coverage, or social media promotions. These rumors often cause many investors to buy the stock, driving the price of the stock up. Then the promoters or others working with them “dump” their own shares before the hype ends. Typically, after the promoters profit from their sales, the stock price drops, and the remaining investors lose most of their money.

Microcap stocks, some of which are penny stocks or nano cap stocks, may be particularly vulnerable to investment schemes, including scams involving AI-related claims. Microcap stocks are low-priced stocks issued by the smallest of companies. There’s often limited publicly available information about microcap companies’ management, products, services and finances. This can make it easier for fraudsters to spread false information about a company and profit at the expense of unsuspecting investors.

Celebrity Endorsements. It’s never a good idea to make an investment decision just because someone famous says a product or service is a good investment. Increasing numbers of investors are using social media to research opportunities and connect with others. Influencers have taken notice, and social media has become more saturated with financial content than ever before, leading to the rise of the financial influencer or “finfluencer.” While celebrities and other well-known personalities might be very good at what they do in their respective professions, a celebrity endorsement doesn’t mean that an investment is legitimate or that it’s appropriate for all investors. Ask yourself: “Why is this person endorsing this investment, and does it fit in my financial plan?”

Steps you can take to protect yourself:

Investors should carefully review the disclosures that companies are making and assess their promotional campaigns. If the company appears focused more on attracting investors through promotions than on developing its business, you might want to compare it to other companies working on similar AI products or services to assess the risks. 
Use the SEC’s EDGAR database to access disclosures for public companies.
See NASAA’s Investor Alert, “Financial Advice Via Social Media—the Rise of the ‘Finfluencer.’”
AI-Enabled Technology Used to Scam Investors, Including “Deepfake” Video and Audio

Fraudsters can use AI technology to clone voices, alter images and even create fake videos to spread false or misleading information. AI technology might be used to impersonate a family member or friend, with the intent to convince an investor to transfer money or securities out of an investment account. For example, some scam artists are using AI-generated audio—also known as “deepfake” audio—to try to lure older investors into thinking a grandchild is in financial distress and need of money. Scammers might use deepfake videos to imitate the CEO of a company announcing false news in an attempt to manipulate the price of a stock, or might use AI technology to produce realistic looking websites or marketing materials to promote fake investments or fraudulent schemes. In addition, we regularly see bad actors impersonating SEC staff and other government officials.

Steps you can take to protect yourself:

Verify that a communication from a federal, state or provincial agency or other regulatory body is genuine before responding by contacting their office directly using the contact information on their website. We have links below to the SEC, NASAA members and FINRA. For other agencies, be sure to independently search for contact information rather than clicking on links or calling numbers in the communication you receive.
Fraudsters might also impersonate legitimate investment professionals—and many use phony personal websites to bolster their credibility. In the U.S., verify that you’re communicating with the actual investment professional and not an imposter by comparing the phone number or website for the firm as disclosed in the firm’s Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS).
Be on the lookout for scammers using AI technology to impersonate family or friends. AI-generated tools might be able to access personal information about you online or on social media, so be wary of any unsolicited communication asking you to invest your money—even if it sounds like it was written just for you. Fraudsters pretending to be friends or family members in distress seek to stir up your emotions. No matter how urgent the plea—especially when accompanied by directives such as “don’t tell my ___ [parents/spouse/roommates]”—take time to independently verify the situation before agreeing to transfer money or securities out of your investment account. Consider creating a password or phrase for family members to verify their identity in case of an emergency. 
Don’t Rely Solely on AI-Generated Information in Making Investment Decisions

Be cautious about using AI-generated information to make investment decisions or to attempt to predict changes in the stock market’s direction or in the price of a security. AI-generated information might rely on data that is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. For example, it could be based on false or outdated information about financial, political, or other news events. Or it could draw from false or misleading information that was disseminated to try to manipulate a stock’s price (either positively or negatively). Even when based on accurate input, information resulting from AI can be faulty, or even completely made up.

Depending on how it’s presented, AI-generated information—particularly conversations with chatbots—could lead you to make misinformed, emotionally-driven or impulsive investment decisions, which can be a risky way to approach investing.

Steps you can take to protect yourself:

Be aware that AI can generate and spread false or inaccurate information. Confirm the authenticity of underlying sources and review multiple sources of information before making investment decisions.
Check in with a registered investment professional and ask questions.

Protecting Your Investment Accounts From GenAI Fraud,https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/gen-ai-fraud-new-accounts-and-takeovers,"Avoid Fraud
Protecting Your Investment Accounts From GenAI Fraud
JANUARY 15, 2025
 

Investment fraud involving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is on the rise. Increasingly, fraudsters are using generative AI (GenAI) tools to gain access to financial accounts and create new accounts in the names of unsuspecting investors.

How Fraudsters Are Using GenAI

GenAI is a type of AI that can create new content based on a user’s prompts. For example, tools using GenAI technology can write essays and computer code; generate realistic images, audio and video; drive chatbots that interact with humans; and perform more functions than database searches that simply return results in response to word or information queries. GenAI is making it easier for bad actors to fraudulently open new accounts using investors’ identities and to improperly gain access to investors’ accounts.

Fraudsters are using GenAI’s capabilities to exploit traditional identification (ID) verification processes and commit new account fraud and account takeovers in multiple ways, including the following:

Social Engineering – Social engineering involves tricking or manipulating targets into giving away sensitive information or allowing remote access to their computer. Fraudsters might use GenAI to analyze your social media activity to create highly personalized phishing emails that could lead you to fraudulent websites embedded with malicious links.
Voice Clones – With GenAI, fraudsters need only three seconds of audio of you speaking to create a credible-sounding imitation, or voice clone. Using this voice clone, they might persuade you to grant access to your accounts, for example, by impersonating a loved one of yours in distress or under financial duress.
Fake ID Documents – Fraudsters can use GenAI to create convincing fake ID documents—such as driver’s licenses or professional credentials—that might also incorporate AI-generated images. They can use these documents to verify identity to fraudulently open a new account or to take over an existing account.
Deepfake Selfies – Some firms have incorporated requests for selfie photos and videos into their customer-verification process. Fraudsters can take images from investors’ social media and use GenAI to create deepfakes to get around these security checks.
Protecting Your Accounts

GenAI’s ability to create credible-looking (or -sounding) fakes increases fraud risk. However, you can take steps to help protect your financial accounts:

Choose strong passwords. Create complex passwords that are unique to each account, and avoid using easily guessable passwords and security questions.
Use a password manager. A password manager is a software application that securely stores and manages your login credentials, including usernames and passwords, for various online accounts. The main benefits of using a password manager include secure storage, unique and complex passwords, and centralized management.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). Enabling MFA on all of your accounts adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password by requiring you to also enter a code that’s sent to your mobile phone via text message or through an authentication application to your account. Choose to have MFA codes or messages sent to your phone rather than via email (if given a choice). Ignore or reject all MFA codes and messages that you weren’t expecting, and then follow the steps in the next bullet.
Protect against impersonation scams. If you receive a security-related message over phone, text or email claiming to be from one of your service providers, don’t respond with identity-verifying information or click on links in case the message is a phishing attempt. Instead, contact the firm directly through its website or by a phone number provided on an account statement or its website. This will help you ensure that the company or individual you’re communicating with is legitimate.
Use biometric verification. Some biometric identifiers, like facial scans or fingerprints, are unique to each person and can be harder for fraudsters to replicate.
Be aware of phishing attempts. Be cautious of incoming emails, texts or calls that ask for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or suspicious. Avoid sharing sensitive details like passwords, account numbers or credit card information with unknown individuals, and limit the personal details you share on social media.
Monitor account activity regularly. Actively review your account statements and online activity for suspicious transactions or logins from unfamiliar locations that could indicate a potential account takeover. Login history for your account is often found in the platform’s “security” or “privacy” section. Some platforms proactively alert you by email when there’s a login for your account from an unfamiliar location.
Use identity-theft protection and credit monitoring services. These services can warn you of possible data breaches and initiate protective measures. If you believe your data has been compromised, consider requesting a credit freeze. This might decrease the chances of a bad actor opening fraudulent financial accounts in your name.
Report suspicious activity immediately. If you suspect fraudulent activity, contact your financial institution, regulatory authorities and local police or law enforcement (see below) right away to report the issue and initiate security measures.
Monitoring for New Account Fraud

Watch for new account fraud by:

monitoring your credit reports regularly for accounts opened in your name that you didn’t authorize;
looking into notifications regarding new accounts that are unfamiliar to you; and
checking your bank statements for transactions you don’t recognize.

Some of the same actions that can help you avoid having your existing account information stolen—including securing your accounts and avoiding phishing attempts—might also reduce your chances of facing new account fraud.

GenAI has made it easier to impersonate consumers and commit fraud. Although financial institutions are working to fight fraud on their platforms, it’s in your interest to also take actions to protect yourself and to alert firms to any suspicious activity.

If you think you’ve been a target or victim of GenAI or other investment fraud, submit a regulatory tip to FINRA, the SEC and/or the FBI’s Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). Learn more about the use of GenAI and financial fraud."
Steps Older Adults Can Take to Reduce Fraud Risk,https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/older-adults-reduce-fraud-risk,"Avoid Fraud
Steps Older Adults Can Take to Reduce Fraud Risk
AUGUST 19, 2025
 

It’s an unfortunate reality that older adults, who have had more time to accumulate wealth, are at an increased risk of being targeted by some fraudsters—and of losing more money per fraud incident. However, the risk might not affect everyone equally. In research by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, certain behaviors and characteristics were found to be associated with an increased risk of fraud victimization in older adults.

Some of these risk factors include: engagement in activities that increase fraud exposure, such as opening all of your mail (especially unsolicited marketing materials or sweepstakes announcements), participating in conversations with telemarketers and answering unknown calls or texts; a preference for higher financial risk; loneliness; and financial fragility.

How to Help Reduce Risk

Reduce your exposure. Cut off contact before it starts by taking precautions like declining or blocking calls from unknown numbers, deleting messages from unknown senders, saying no to or hanging up on telemarketing offers, and throwing away junk mail. If you suspect a text message or email is spam, block and report the sender.

Ignore promises of big rewards. There are no guarantees with investing. Look out for red flags like promises of risk-free investing, guaranteed returns and high profits. Be especially wary if you were solicited for an investment when you weren’t even looking for one. Likewise, competitions and prize drawings, particularly if they require an upfront fee, are often fraudulent.

Check out sellers and products. Be alert to signs of imposter investment scams and, before you make any investment, research the seller and the product to make sure they’re legitimate and a good fit for you. You can look up financial professionals using FINRA BrokerCheck to confirm whether they’re registered and/or licensed and view their employment history.

Stay connected. If you’re struggling with feelings of loneliness, try to bolster your existing relationships or seek new connections in person, rather than virtually. Unfortunately, random contact from strangers online or via text message is all too often the start of a scam. Reach out to family and friends, if possible, whether in person or from a distance, and look for opportunities to participate in community programs and interact with others.

Monitor your emotions. Don’t make investing decisions in a rush or when your emotions are strong. Take time to think things over—or even better, talk over decisions with someone you trust.

Practice healthy financial habits. To bolster your sense of financial security, develop a budget for yourself and try to build an emergency fund. If you’re not sure where to start, look for money management webinars and/or financial counseling services offered by banks, libraries and local nonprofit organizations.

Increase your financial knowledge. Having a foundational knowledge about financial products and the basics of investing can make fraudulent offers easier to spot. If you have a brokerage account, make sure you know how to read your account statements, and take steps to protect your financial accounts like adding a trusted contact. 

Stay informed about fraud. The more people hear about different scams, the less susceptible they are, which is a great reason to keep learning. Educate yourself about the red flags of fraud and current scams to be on the lookout for. Organizations like AARP and the BBB can help you learn about and track current scams. You can also look for coverage by your local news outlet, or discuss the matter with people you trust.

Resources

If you have a question or concern about your brokerage account or an investment recommendation, you can call FINRA’s Securities Helpline for Seniors toll-free at 844-574-3577. You can also file a complaint about a brokerage firm with FINRA or submit a tip about possible securities fraud to the SEC.

If you think you’ve been the victim of a scam, report it to law enforcement. 

Federal Law Enforcement: You can report to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (if the fraud occurred online) and the Federal Trade Commission.
You can also report the fraud to your state attorney general’s office, district attorney and/or local police department.

And if you’re experiencing emotional effects from fraud, there are resources available to help.

Beware of Stock Fraud in the Wake of Natural Disasters,https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/natural-disaster-fraud,"Avoid Fraud
Beware of Stock Fraud in the Wake of Natural Disasters
JANUARY 23, 2025
 

Natural disasters often bring out the best in people, with many quick to donate money, supplies or labor to help strangers affected by wildfires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other calamities. Unfortunately, these disasters can bring out the worst in others, some of whom seek to exploit the situation to commit financial fraud.

You might see posts on social media or receive phone calls, emails or messages, in the form of texts or from messaging apps, promoting investments that benefit from a disaster-related opportunity. Scams might include stocks associated with cleanup or rebuilding efforts or breakthroughs in science and technology that purport to address current and future disaster-avoidance strategies. While it’s possible that some of the claims being made are true, others could be false assertions promoting scams.

Spotting Potential Disaster-Related Investment Scams

Unsolicited communications about investments that exploit a natural disaster frequently include:

price targets or predictions of quick and substantial profits;
the use of facts from respected news sources to bolster claims of a price run-up—for example, that some percentage of the billions of dollars it will take to rebuild after a disaster will contribute directly to a company's bottom line;
mention of contracts or affiliations with federal government agencies or large, well-known companies;
standard corporate developments, like contracting with a supplier, presented as major events;
statements claiming that it’s much easier for low-priced stocks to soar in value compared with higher-priced stocks; and
pressure to invest immediately.
How to Protect Yourself From Disaster-Related Scams

To avoid potential scams, make sure you get the information you need to make an informed investment choice.

Investigate before you invest. Never rely solely on information you receive in an unsolicited message from someone promoting a stock. Use FINRA BrokerCheck to check an individual’s registration status and learn additional information about investment professionals and firms.
Find out who sent the message. Many companies and individuals who encourage stock investments are corporate insiders or are paid to promote the stock. Look for statements that indicate someone is being compensated for disseminating this information. Check the fine print for this type of detail.
Find out where the stock trades. Most unsolicited stock recommendations involve stocks that can't meet the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange or other U.S. exchanges. Instead, these stocks tend to be quoted on an over-the-counter (OTC) quotation platform where regulatory disclosure requirements are often lower.
Read the company's SEC filings. Most public companies file reports with the SEC. Check the SEC's EDGAR database to find out whether the company files with the SEC. Read the reports and verify any information you’ve heard about the company. But remember, the fact that a company has registered its securities or has filed reports with the SEC doesn't necessarily mean that the company will be a good investment.

If you're suspicious about an offer regarding a disaster-related investment, you can file a complaint with FINRA, contact FEMA’s Investigations and Inspections Division or file a complaint with the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud."

FINRA Foundation Releases Findings on Fraud Awareness Among Investors
Half of Investors Do Not Recognize Warning Signs of Fraud; Findings Released in Light of World Investor Week

WASHINGTON—In light of World Investor Week (Oct. 6-12), the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today first-look findings from its forthcoming report, “Investors in the United States: A Report of the National Financial Capability Study,” which will be published in December. The report provides an in-depth exploration of the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the United States.

As part of the study, researchers asked a sample of investors across the United States a question about investment fraud:

If you heard about an investment opportunity that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years, would you invest in it?
1. Yes
2. No
3. Don’t know 

Despite describing guaranteed and very high investment returns, two hallmarks of investment fraud, half of respondents (50%) indicated they would invest in the hypothetical offer, indicating a lack of recognition about the warning signs of fraud. Investors who are younger, less experienced and less knowledgeable about investing are even more likely to say they would invest in the “opportunity.” The data further reveals that investors who engage with investments that can carry greater risk, such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks, as well as those who rely on social media for financial information, are particularly open to a hypothetical investment that promises much more than it can deliver.

Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity

Notably, the differences by income in the proportion of investors willing to invest in the hypothetical offer were less pronounced, with only four percentage-points separating those earning under $50,000 and those earning $100,000 or more.  

Would invest in a “guaranteed high-return” opportunity

“These findings reveal that a concerning number of investors might be vulnerable to investment fraud,” said Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation. “All investments involve some level of risk, and investors must understand their own risk tolerance to make informed decisions. At the same time, investors must learn to spot the red flags of investment fraud—including the promise of little to no risk with unusually high returns,” she said.

The full report, part of the FINRA Foundation’s triennial National Financial Capability Study, will provide comprehensive insights to help financial professionals, educators, regulators and others serve and protect investors of all backgrounds and experience levels.

Additional findings:

Investing knowledge: Investors with high investing knowledge were less likely to invest in the hypothetical opportunity than those with low investing knowledge. Thirty-six percent of those with high investing knowledge report they would invest, compared to 49% of those with low investing knowledge.
Crypto and meme stock investors: More crypto investors report they would invest in this “opportunity” than non-crypto investors (65% vs. 44%, respectively), while those who have purchased a meme-stock or viral investment are even more likely to look favorably upon the hypothetical investment than those who have not purchased a meme stock (77% vs. 45%, respectively).
Influenced by social media personalities: Almost three-quarters (72%) of study respondents who at least sometimes make investing decisions based on the advice of a social media personality said they would invest in the hypothetical opportunity. The survey found those relying on social media would be much more likely to invest than those who don’t (69% vs. 42%, respectively).

About the National Financial Capability Study

In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability—including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.

National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The Investor Survey is an online survey of 2,861 U.S. adults who have investments outside of retirement accounts. The data provides detailed information on a wide range of investing topics, such as attitudes towards risk and investing, investor knowledge, and reliance on so-called “finfluencers.”

Tips to Avoid Mail Theft-Related Check Fraud,https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/mail-theft-check-fraud,"Protect Your Money
Tips to Avoid Mail Theft-Related Check Fraud
SEPTEMBER 25, 2025
 

Incidents involving mail theft-related check fraud are on the rise, which could impact individuals expecting to receive funds through a check in the mailbox. Since 2021, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service has reported a nearly 400 percent increase in mail theft-related fraud overall, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has seen an increase in reporting of these incidents by financial institutions, including banks and brokerage firms. This type of fraud often involves bad actors who steal physical checks from mailboxes or U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or other courier collection boxes, then alter or counterfeit the stolen checks for fraudulent purposes.  

If you experience this type of theft, you might be able to recover your funds from your financial institution. However, this can take time if an investigation is involved, and you might not have access to your money until after the investigation is complete. If a check payment is stolen, your personally identifiable financial information could be compromised, and your credit score could be impacted.

Reduce Your Risk of Mail Theft-Related Fraud

Taking the following precautions might help you secure your incoming mail and reduce your risk of experiencing mail theft:

Promptly pick up your mail. Leaving your mail in your mailbox for a prolonged period increases your risk of theft.
Stay informed about deliveries. USPS offers Informed Delivery, a service that lets you preview your incoming mail and track packages so you can anticipate the arrival of valuable mail items. Most courier services, including FedEx and UPS, also offer tracking or delivery notification capabilities.
Use mail holding services. If you’re traveling or will be otherwise unable to access your mail for a period of time, USPS offers the option to hold your mail at your local post office for up to 30 days, for free. If you’ll be gone longer than that, you can sign up to have your mail forwarded to another location. Other parcel carriers typically offer holding or forwarding services as well, though the length of time and other options may vary.
Secure your mailbox. Consider purchasing a locking residential mailbox, which can deter casual thieves and help prevent theft. You might also consider renting a P.O. box at your local USPS for increased security.
Opt for electronic payments. When possible, consider requesting to receive online payments, such as e-checks or ACH deposits. While all forms of payment have some risk, electronic payment methods might provide enhanced security and are often faster and more convenient. Always take safety measures to protect online financial accounts.
Follow up. If you’re expecting a check or credit card in the mail, contact the sender if you don’t receive it in a timely manner.

You can also take the following steps to protect your outgoing mail:

Employ extra security measures. Use checks with enhanced security features such as watermarks, holograms or microprinting. Consider using envelopes that conceal the presence of a check.
Practice good check-writing habits. Always fill out the check completely using indelible black ink, and don’t include personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers or driver’s license numbers. Fill in any unused space on the payee and/or amount payable lines with a horizontal line rather than leaving blank space. 
Use secure drop-offs. Curbside mailboxes or residential outboxes are easier to target and therefore more prone to theft. Using secure drop boxes that are attached to or within USPS or other parcel service locations can deter thieves.
Use online banking. Consider making payments online rather than by mail. If you do mail a check, use online or mobile banking services to review the check details to ensure it wasn’t altered, as well as to regularly review account activity for any unusual transactions. 
Where to Go for Help

If you don’t receive a check or other expected correspondence from your brokerage firm, report the incident to your firm as soon as possible. You can also file a regulatory tip with FINRA. 

Mail theft-related fraud should also be reported to your local police and the delivery carrier. For USPS deliveries, use the Mail Fraud Complaint Form or call (877) 876-2455. You can also report fraud to the FBI via their Electronic Tip Form or by calling 800-CALLFBI (800-225-5324).

00:00 - 00:29

Kaitlyn Kiernan: In the securities industry today, there is little daylight between money laundering and fraud. As these two spaces have come to increasingly overlap, FINRA created the Special Investigations Unit, or SIU. On this episode, four members from this team of anti-money laundering and anti-fraud specialists join us to share how they work to detect and investigate cases of illicit finance and market abuse, as well as how they look to proactively identify and mitigate threats.

 

00:29 – 00:38

Intro Music

 

00:38- 01:04

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Welcome to FINRA Unscripted. I'm your host, Kaitlyn Kiernan. I'm pleased to welcome four guests to the show today to introduce us to the Special Investigations Unit within Member Supervision's National Cause and Financial Crimes Detection Program. Joining me are Gargi Sharma, senior director of the Special Investigations Unit, and three investigative directors from her team Kayla Le, Peter Gonzales and David Byrne. Gargi, David, Peter and Kayla, thanks so much for joining me. 

 

01:05 - 01:10

Gargi Sharma: Thank you so much for having us on the podcast. This is my first time and I'm very excited to be here. 

 

01:10 - 01:21

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Yes, we have four first time guests, which is awesome. To kick us off, can you each start by introducing yourselves and sharing a little bit about your background? Gargi, maybe we can start with you. 

 

01:21 - 02:20

Gargi Sharma: Sure. Gargi Sharma, as you said. I lead the FINRA Special Investigations Unit or SIU. I've been with FINRA for over 15 years. FINRA is where I actually started my professional journey. I joined FINRA right after grad school in the Dallas office as an examiner conducting routine examinations. I also worked in FINRA's Seattle office. I left FINRA due to a move to Minnesota. While there, I worked for the Federal Reserve Bank. Although I enjoyed working at the Fed, I knew I wanted to come back to FINRA and move to a place that was a bit warmer. In 2013, I got an opportunity to return, and I joined FINRA's Boca Raton office, again as an examiner conducting routine examinations. I found my passion for AML through these examinations. So, when there was an opening on the AML team, I applied and was accepted. I left the AML team to take a leadership position within firm exam and returned to the team four years ago. 

 

02:21 - 02:32

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Awesome. Well, Minnesota to Boca. I don't know if you get more opposite ends of the spectrum weather-wise, so definitely warmer weather. Kayla, do you want to go next? 

 

02:32 - 02:53

Kayla Le: Sure. My name is Kayla Le and I lead the SIU team focused on market abuse. I started my FINRA career 10 years ago in the market regulation group focused on trading practices. After about three years there, I made the transition to member supervision exam program before landing in the Special Investigations Unit as an investigator and now leading one of the teams. 

 

02:54 - 02:56

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Awesome. Thank you. David, how are you? 

 

02:56 - 03:33

David Byrne: Okay, then. My name is David Byrne and I lead the SIU team focused on illicit finance. I started my career in wealth management, where I had a front row seat to the 2008 market crash. I then moved down to Florida and spent seven years at FINRA, where my last role was managing the AML team. In 2017, I left FINRA to start my own anti-fraud business, which protected pro athletes from fraud. And then in 2021, I went to work for a fintech, starting to help build their AML compliance program. And just one month ago, I very happily came back to FINRA to work on this team. So it's been full circle. 

 

03:34 - 03:42

Kaitlyn Kiernan: So we're up to two boomerang employees now. And to clarify, though, it's spelled the same. You are not the David Byrne of Talking Heads. 

 

03:43 - 03:48

David Byrne: I am not, unfortunately. I think I would have been having a bit of a different career projection. 

 

03:48 - 03:56

Kaitlyn Kiernan: That would be an interesting get if that was his side hustle, was working at FINRA. And Peter, how about you? 

 

03:56 - 04:33

Peter Gonzalez: So my name is Peter Gonzalez and I lead our Anti-Fraud Investigations Unit, or AFI for short. And prior to ascending to this role, I was an investigator on FINRA's Crypto Assets Unit. And previous to that, I supported another AFI, the Advancing Financial Inclusion Framework at the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. I am not a boomerang. I've served and supported FINRA for almost 20 years in various roles, including the firm examination program, the launch of both the AML Investigative Unit and the Senior Helpline, and various other programs aligned with our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 

 

04:33 - 04:47

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Great. Thanks, Peter. So, Gargi, you head the SIU as it's called. Can you give us a high level overview of what the Special Investigations Unit does and how it fits within FINRA more broadly? 

 

04:47 - 05:30

Gargi Sharma: Sure. As you mentioned, Kaitlin, Special Investigations Unit is part of Member Supervision, and sits within National Cause and Financial Crimes Detection Program under Complex Investigations and Intelligence, or CII. The SIU is comprised of two units, an AML Investigative Unit and an Anti-Fraud Investigative Unit, or AFI. The AML Investigative Unit has been in place for almost a decade. It was one of the first specialist teams at FINRA, and served as a model for what later became CII. As threats in the industry have evolved, we saw more and more overlap between money laundering and fraud. As a result, we added the AFI specialist team three years ago. 

 

05:30 - 05:33

Kaitlyn Kiernan: AML and RFI, what do they focus on? 

 

05:33 - 06:08:28

Gargi Sharma: Let me start with some stats. Per FinCEN, the securities and futures industry filed more than 61,000 suspicious activity reports in 2022, and about the same in 2023. The number of filings has doubled in the last five years. Also, the top two suspicious activity categories are ACH fraud and identity theft. In terms of investment fraud, the FBI noted that 4.57 billion in losses were reported in 2023, which is over one third or $1.2 billion increase when compared to losses in 2022. 

 

06:09 - 06:48

Gargi Sharma: This tells us that member firms are combating threats related to money laundering and fraud on a daily basis, which puts a high burden on their AML, fraud and cyber compliance teams. We're tracking this information and our structure reflects the type of threats the industry is facing so that we're meeting the current and future demands. We've heard Greg Ruppert, Omer Meisel and others talk about ""left of the boom,"" which means proactively identifying and mitigating threats. The AML and AFI teams focus on exactly this by proactively identifying and mitigating emerging and most complex threats related to money laundering and fraud. 

 

06:48 - 07:13

Gargi Sharma: SIU covers these threats to ensure markets are safer for investors. We achieve this primarily through investigations. We also dedicate our efforts in educating the industry and investors and sharing intelligence internally and externally. Through education and intel sharing, we want to equip firms with the information they need to make their processes and systems better to protect itself and its customers from these threats. 

 

07:15 - 07:27

Kaitlyn Kiernan: That sounds like a lot of really great work going on. And AML and this fraud landscape, they're evolving really quickly. So how has SIU evolved as these threats in the industry have also evolved?

 

07:28 - 08:05

Gargi Sharma: From our communication with member firms, we hear and see how compliance teams at firms are structured. Firms typically have trade surveillance and asset movement surveillance functions within their compliance structure. In response and as a natural progression of SIU's mission, AML and AFI teams further develop expertise in two subcategories: market abuse and illicit finance. Kayla, David, and Peter will talk about these two subcategories in a bit. I just want to point out that the evolution to further specialize prepares SIU to respond effectively as the threat environment evolves. 

 

08:06 - 08:16

Kaitlyn Kiernan: And to follow up, Gargi just mentioned that Kayla, Peter and David would tell us more about each of their teams. So can we dig into that a little bit more? Kayla, maybe you can start. 

 

08:16 - 08:52

Kayla Le: Yeah, absolutely. So the Market Abuse team focuses on how bad actors are using trading to generate or launder illicit proceeds, including informally moving assets through the securities industry. Manipulative trading practices can come in various forms, including pump and dump schemes, insider trading, spoofing, layering and wash trading, to name a few. Our team investigates a member firm's AML program to ensure that it reasonably detects, investigates, and, if needed, reports, red flags or patterns of suspicious trading activities. 

 

08:52 - 09:24

Kayla Le: It's important to note how surveillance of suspicious trading is critical, and in many ways, it's unique to AML compliance in the securities industry. Securities trading can be used to generate illicit proceeds, as there is no need for placement, and can be used in the layering and integration phase of an AML scheme. Ensuring that our member firms have a reasonable AML program in place is critical given the value of Bank Secrecy Act or BSA-related intelligence to regulators and law enforcement agencies. 

 

09:25 - 09:45

Kaitlyn Kiernan: One of our very early episodes, like six and a half years ago, was on AML and how it's different in the securities industry. We'll link to that in the show notes. While it's six plus years old at this point, the foundations are still very accurate. So if you missed that if you're a newer listener to the podcast, check that out. And David, how about you? 

 

09:46 - 10:25

David Byrne: The Illicit Finance team focuses on how bad actors are using transfer systems such as wires, ACHs and even account transfers to generate illicit proceeds and launder money through the securities industry. Just like Kayla mentioned, our investigations typically review how a firm's anti-money laundering compliance program has been built to monitor, detect and report suspicious activity involving those transfer systems. Of course, you need customers to facilitate these transfer systems. So my team also looks to see if our member firms are conducting reasonable initial and ongoing risk based due diligence on their customers in order to understand the nature and purpose of their accounts. 

 

10:25 - 10:27

Kaitlyn Kiernan: And Peter, last but not least. 

 

10:27 - 10:58

Peter Gonzalez: So similar to its two AML sister units, the Anti-Fraud Investigations team focuses on market abuse and illicit finance, except we do so through a slightly different lens. AFI focuses on member firms or registered persons that are directly engaged in fraudulent activity or willfully allow a bad actor to engage in fraud within the securities industry, such as conducting a Ponzi scheme or participating in market manipulation. 

 

10:58 - 11:22

Peter Gonzalez: We also pay close attention to the fraudulent activity impacting investors, our member firms and their registered representatives here. Here, third-party bad actors beyond FINRA's jurisdictional reach target various facets of the securities industry with a wide range of tactics, including imposter schemes, ramp and dump schemes and investment club schemes. 

 

11:24 - 11:38

Kaitlyn Kiernan: And I imagine you see some overlap in your work with the work of others across FINRA. Kayla, you were talking about market abuse. We also have the market regulation teams. How do you see the overlap in your work with others? 

 

11:39 - 12:14

Kayla Le: We see the overlap quite often. Coordination happens naturally, especially with groups such as the FIU and enforcement. FIU provides them an actionable intelligence given their proactive monitoring of emerging threats, while enforcement partners with us as we conduct our investigations. Coordination also happens naturally based upon the threats that we are monitoring and investigating. For example, we partner with Market Regulation often to leverage intelligence that they have gathered through their surveillance efforts as part of our investigations and to ensure that we're not duplicating regulatory efforts. 

 

12:14 - 12:45

Kayla Le: Oftentimes, our group leverage investigations conducted by other groups to identify potential violations of FINRA rules or securities laws. Together, all of FINRA works together to identify misconduct, stop fraud and prevent losses, obtain restitution for harmed investors, and remove bad actors from FINRA's membership. We also partner with CRED, or Credentialing, Registration, Education and Disclosure, and Member Relations as part of our education and intelligence sharing efforts.

 

12:46 - 13:36

Peter Gonzalez: So something that you'll hear in this podcast that happened six years ago is the fact that you can generate illicit proceeds directly on a brokerage account through fraudulent activities, such as insider trading or market manipulation. And that is a very unique space where fraud and money laundering intersect in the securities industry. Our teams, AML and AFI, we intentionally live on the same branch of the family tree. We are housed within Complex Investigations and Intelligence, with teams like Cyber and Analytics, and Vulnerable Adults and Seniors. The cross collaboration is constant and consistent due to our overlap and common mission. It is a theme we've highlighted in previous FINRA Unscripted podcast. Fighting fraud is a team endeavor, not just within CII, but across the organization. 

 

13:36 - 13:41

Kaitlyn Kiernan: I love that family tree analogy. And David, how about your side of the group? 

 

13:42 - 14:28

David Byrne: One of my first days back at FINRA, I was working with an analyst from the Financial Intelligence Unit, or FIU, as we've called it, a new account and ACH fraud. And then the same day, collaborating with our Cyber & Analytics unit to address the cyber risks associated with that activity. And then the next day, I was speaking with an enforcement attorney on an investigation I was getting up to speed on. So we're collaborating a lot across teams and across departments. Another great example of collaboration across teams was when our teams consulted with our National Cause team on an AML matter, and SIU thought the matter should be raised to our High Risk Representatives team, given the activities detailed. So there's a lot of work done across FINRA. And then, every day, I'm talking with Peter, Kayla and Gargi. So we're all aligned on what's going on with our teams and sharing information. 

 

14:29 - 14:49

Kaitlyn Kiernan: We recently had an episode with the High Risk Representative team, so if that's a new team name to you, check out the show notes. We'll link to that as well. So Gargi, there's a lot of really big and important things that I imagine coming through the door, through the different parts of the team. How do you prioritize the different threats and investigations? 

 

14:50 - 15:30

Gargi Sharma: We primarily leverage and prioritize based on intelligence, data and analytics. For example, we prioritize the small cap IPO threat based on intelligence or Financial Intelligence unit gathered and disseminated. Similarly, we partnered with our Analytics Threat Targeting team within Cyber & Analytical Unit to effectively identify new account fraud and related fraudulent conduct such as ACATS and ACH fraud. This way, we're focusing our very limited resources on emerging and complex, high-risk threats that pose significant risks and impact to the investors and to the markets. 

 

15:31 - 15:37

Kaitlyn Kiernan: And Peter, on the fraud side, where are your investigations and issues coming from? 

 

15:37 - 16:21

Peter Gonzalez: So there are more than 620,000 registered representatives and more than 250 million customer accounts in the securities industry. If 99% of them are participating in our securities markets with good intent, it still leaves quite a few registered representatives and customer accounts where investigations and issues can arise. As I mentioned, fighting fraud is a team endeavor. The sharing of expertise across the organization is vital. We leverage our great partnerships with FINRA's Financial Intelligence Unit, its Market Regulation and Risk Monitoring teams, as well as the Initial Review group, which manages the intake of all customer complaints being received by the organization. 

 

16:22 - 16:32

Kaitlyn Kiernan: We talked about overlap and coordination within FINRA. But David, can you talk a little bit about how your work overlaps with firms or other regulators or law enforcement? 

 

16:33 - 17:11

David Byrne: One of the great things about coming back to FINRA is to see how much FINRA has progressed in collaboration and communication across our landscape with the FBI, the SEC, state regulators and our member firms. We're coordinating to protect investors and to understand new trends and threats. With our member firms, Complex Investigations and Intelligence, or CII as we've called it, participates in conferences and roundtables to communicate as much as we can about the novel trends we've seen and provide our expertise not just in AML and fraud, but with our Cyber & Analytics unit, Vulnerable Adult and Seniors team, and High Risk Representatives team. 

 

17:12 - 17:56

David Byrne: Another way FINRA communicates with the industries through resources and research that we put out, including regulatory notices and FIU's threat intelligence products. And Kaitlyn, you had a really informative podcast with Blake Snyder on the FIU's role to help inform FINRA and the industry on emerging threats and intelligence, and that's definitely worth checking out for the listeners. One other place, FINRA has an Office of Regulatory Liaison and Law Enforcement Liaison, which is a team dedicated to developing relationships so that we are receiving and sharing relevant information and intelligence timely with law enforcement and regulatory agencies. That includes the FBI, OFAC, FinCEN, the SEC. This could be simply just picking up the phone, or it could be something more formal through a written referral or request. 

 

17:57 - 18:08

Kaitlyn Kiernan: And earlier, we talked about how SIU works to prioritize some of the different threats and investigations. How do you work to actually mitigate some of those threats? 

 

18:08 - 18:35

Gargi Sharma: So from mitigating perspective, it's really by working together. Robert Cook recently mentioned this when talking about disrupting the cycle of financial fraud: that we really need to work together and share actionable intelligence as quickly as possible within the industry, the investors and other external stakeholders such as the SEC and the FBI. This can be an alert, a regulatory notice, or even a threat intelligence product. 

 

18:35 - 19:09

Gargi Sharma: As an example, I was speaking to an executive within Member Firms' Financial Crimes unit during FINRA's annual conference about trends that they're observing in day to day. They happened to mention ACATS fraud, and how difficult it was to detect red flags of fraudulent ACATS requests given they had very limited turnaround time. SIU quickly engaged with the industry through roundtables and through groups like SIFMA. Once we gather the challenges, the red flags and best practices, we issued relevant regulatory notices and provided guidance through our Annual Oversight Report. 

 

19:09 - 19:30

Kaitlyn Kiernan: You mentioned the annual conference registration for 2025 is open, and I attended Gargi's panel at last year's conference and it was fantastic. So highly recommend that you register for that to join next May. So can you share any recent investigative trends that you have seen? Kayla, maybe you can kick us off?

 

19:31 - 20:18

Kayla Le: Manipulative trading in small cap IPOs or ramp and dump schemes, which was previously mentioned, has been emerging risk for a few years and it continues to be an emerging risk today. We have seen significant unexplained price increases that occur on the day of, or shortly after the IPO of certain small cap issuers based in restricted markets such as China. These price increases appear to be associated with trading by apparent nominee accounts that invest in the small cap IPO and subsequently engage in apparent manipulative order and trading activity. We've communicated that red flags to look for and best practices through our annual regulatory reports. We've also issued Regulatory Notice 22-25 with Nasdaq and NYSE, informing member firms of this heightened threat of fraud. 

 

20:19 - 21:14

Peter Gonzalez: These rampant dump schemes appear to have recently evolved. We've observed the decrease in these schemes occurring on the date of or shortly after the IPO. We are now seeing an increased ramp and dump taking place weeks or even months after the IPO. We do, however, continue to see the scheme being transacted by a variety of nominee accounts and foreign omnibus accounts. Social media continues to play a role. Victims of ramp and dump schemes appear to also be victims of social media scams. Investors are increasingly turning to the internet or social media, and the unregistered actors on those platforms, for investment advice. In fact, research published recently by the FINRA Foundation found that almost half of Gen Z investors learn about investing through social media and the internet, with their top online financial resource being YouTube. 

 

21:15: - 21:17

Kaitlyn Kiernan: David, how about on your side? 

 

21:18 - 21:49

David Byrne: Well, we've briefly talked about new account and ACH fraud. Earlier in the podcast, the National ACH Association reported that ACH transfers in 2023 totalled over $80 trillion. As Gargi stated, ACH fraud was the number one reported suspicious activity, so we know this is top of mind for member firms, and firms are spending a lot of resources to combat this fraud. The SEC and DOJ and some others have also taken notice of first-party ACH fraud schemes and are finding ways to address the issue. 

 

21:49 - 22:39

David Byrne: For example, a group of individuals were charged with running a free riding scheme that involved more than 600 brokerage accounts opened at various broker dealers to generate more than $2 million in illicit profits through abuse of instant funds for trading securities. FINRA has some great guidance we put out there to the industry on recent trends, and I'll point to a few of these worth looking into. Our 2023 report on FINRA's Examination and Risk Monitoring program details the emerging risks of new account fraud. Then, our 2024 report details our findings involving ACH fraud and provides a link to Regulatory Notice 21-14 on ACH fraud. As this threat evolves and we learn more from our industry participants. FINRA is looking at disseminating further guidance through avenues such as threat intelligence products or annual reports or additional regulatory notices. 

 

22:40 - 23:06

Kaitlyn Kiernan: So, David, you just named a bunch of great resources. We will link to those in our show notes. But Kayla and Peter also talked about things that we also have great resources on, including not just for firms, but things that firms can share with their customers as well. So definitely check out the show notes for this episode. But David, speaking of effective practices, are there any effective practices we can generally take out of all this? 

 

23:07 - 24:15

David Byrne: I think it's helpful to have an understanding of all the relevant information a firm has on a customer to identify red flags and prevent these frauds. So, for example, for new account fraud, reviewing IP addresses or other available geolocation data for new online accounts to look for consistency with the customer's home address; reviewing for common identifiers like email, phone number, address that have already been used for previous accounts. For ACATS fraud, having multifactor authentication creates a barrier for the fraudster, having push notifications and emails to the customer, and even if applicable, the registered rep on the account whenever the customer's phone or email have been updated. You can also see if the fraudsters changed the customer's contact information right before the ACAT request as another red flag. And then for ACH fraud, fraudsters continue to exploit instant access for ACH transfers, which allows the fraudster to immediately move the funds before the payment settles. Firms can consider delaying this access until settlement. We've also seen some firms implement a holding period for ACH transfers, where the ACH are frozen for a period of time. 

 

24:15 - 24:54

David Byrne: Lastly, we've seen firms implement additional verification methods, including requesting alternate forms of identification, copies of the account statements, to confirm the customer has available funds to cover the ACH transfer. And one last effective practice I'll mention when it comes to getting relevant information, not only from FINRA, but from FBI, DOJ, FinCEN, and the SEC is to look on their websites to subscribe to email alerts to your area of expertise. By getting these alerts, you can read cases and researches on relevant topics and trends, and I'd recommend setting some time each week on your calendar to stay up to speed on all the helpful information out there. 

 

24:56 - 24:58

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Great tips! And Peter, how about you? 

 

24:58 - 26:03

Peter Gonzalez: So with respect to the threat of ramp and dump schemes, I'll share some effective practices for our member firms, but I would also like to share some effective practices with the investing public. So for our member firms for effective practices regarding your transaction monitoring systems: Does your surveillance system monitor for patterns of suspicious orders and trading activity across multiple customers, across multiple days, or both? Does your surveillance system identify trading that appears to lack legitimate economic sense? Does your firm monitor for potential coordination among customers? Are you looking for numerous unrelated accounts being open on the same day, from the same IP address, sharing a common address, and being controlled by the same person, or multiple accounts depositing shares of the same company at the same time? And lastly, when conducting your surveillance, broaden your perspective. Don't just ask, is my customer a criminal? But also begin to ask, is my customer a victim? 

 

26:03 - 27:01

Peter Gonzalez: For the investing public for effective practices to avoid becoming a victim of investment fraud: Never respond to unsolicited messages from unknown contacts, especially via text message and on encrypted messaging applications. Be wary of any unsolicited investment advice or tips, particularly from someone you've only spoken to online. Always question what they have to gain from sharing tips with you, and whether the investment advice fits with your financial goals and investment strategy. Carefully evaluate the product as well as the person or company requesting your investment. Do a basic internet search and then add words like ""scam"" or ""fraud"" to see what results come up. And lastly, always use FINRA's broker check to see if the person or company giving you investment advice is a registered investment professional. 

 

27:02 - 27:09

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Peter, you are showing your history from working with Investor Education. That was all great information. And Kayla? 

 

27:09 - 27:45

Kayla Le: FINRA has provided a number of resources, including some that have already been mentioned to preview the 2025 Annual Report, we'll continue to highlight threats such as the small cap IPO fraud and also the ongoing risk of ACH fraud, specifically describing first and third-party fraud and providing additional considerations, especially for firms that offer fully online account opening services and rely on automated account opening or customer verification services. So take advantage of these resources, and don't hesitate to reach out to FINRA through your risk monitoring analyst with questions. 

 

27:45 - 28:00

Kaitlyn Kiernan: It's hard to believe, but that 2025 report is just about two months away now. Now Gargi, to wrap up, if our listeners were to walk away remembering just one thing about the Special Investigations Unit, what would you hope it would be? 

 

28:01 - 29:04

Gargi Sharma: Bryan Smith, who heads CII, studied the best in his recent podcast. Our job is to make cases and prevent cases. I really want to drive the prevention message home. Money laundering and fraud aren't a small, medium or large firm problem. All firms are susceptible to it. Bad actors are everywhere, and how their illicit activity shows up in the securities industry can be in plain sight, or sometimes where you least expect it. SIU's response to the current threat environment is constantly evolving to ensure we are proactive and preventative in identifying and mitigating the most complex threats that the financial industry faces in our areas of specialization, essentially being ""left of the boom."" We cannot achieve this effectively without the constant feedback loop that consists of proactively receiving intel on the issue, so that we're able to share it more broadly to the investors and with the industry. In conclusion, if you see something, say something. 

 

29:05 - 29:37

Kaitlyn Kiernan: Thank you, Gargi, and thank you, Kayla, David and Peter. I really enjoyed today's conversation and the opportunity to learn more about the Special Investigations Unit and all the great work that you are doing across the team. Listeners, if you don't already, be sure to subscribe to FINRA Unscripted wherever you listen to podcasts. We are now even available on YouTube since that's where all Gen Z is.
